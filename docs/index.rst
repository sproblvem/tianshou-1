Welcome to Tianshou!
====================

**Tianshou** (`天授 <https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%A9%E6%8E%88>`_) is a reinforcement learning platform based on pure PyTorch. Unlike existing reinforcement learning libraries, which are mainly based on TensorFlow, have many nested classes, unfriendly API, or slow-speed, Tianshou provides a fast-speed framework and pythonic API for building the deep reinforcement learning agent. The supported interface algorithms include:

* :class:`~tianshou.policy.PGPolicy` `Policy Gradient <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf>`_
* :class:`~tianshou.policy.DQNPolicy` `Deep Q-Network <https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf>`_
* :class:`~tianshou.policy.DQNPolicy` `Double DQN <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf>`_ with n-step returns
* :class:`~tianshou.policy.A2CPolicy` `Advantage Actor-Critic <https://openai.com/blog/baselines-acktr-a2c/>`_
* :class:`~tianshou.policy.DDPGPolicy` `Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf>`_
* :class:`~tianshou.policy.PPOPolicy` `Proximal Policy Optimization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf>`_
* :class:`~tianshou.policy.TD3Policy` `Twin Delayed DDPG <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf>`_
* :class:`~tianshou.policy.SACPolicy` `Soft Actor-Critic <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05905.pdf>`_


Tianshou supports parallel workers for all algorithms as well. All of these algorithms are reformatted as replay-buffer based algorithms.
